### R Studio

##### Colors in console

The colors used in the console, eg. for negative numbers, are set via the packages `pillar` and `crayon`.
For negative numbers, the `crayon::red()` doesn't work well with dark themes (see [here](https://github.com/tidyverse/tibble/issues/357), and maybe there is help underway, see [here](https://github.com/r-lib/pillar/issues/82) and [here](https://github.com/r-lib/cli/issues/204)).  
For now, the easiest way to overcome the issue is to set off the use of red in negative numbers while using tibbles, by setting the respective `pillar` option, eg. in the .Rprofile file:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
options(pillar.neg = FALSE)
```
